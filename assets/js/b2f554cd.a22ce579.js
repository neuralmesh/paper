This paper discusses the creation of agents that upgrade recursively through continuous conversation and context-based learning. It\u2019s about creating a cycle of endless improvement, all within an openly accessible repository.\\n\\nIt\'s a non-profit journey where every individual\'s contribution is acknowledged. The project is not just a paper; it\'s an open invitation to be part of a landmark in AI research, where the list of co-authors grows with every contribution.\\n\\nDo you want to influence the future of AI? Engage in this collective project and help us shape intelligent agents that learn from the crowd. It\u2019s a ground-breaking approach that champions open collaboration and shared progress in aligning large language models. Join us, contribute, and advance the frontier of AI together."}]}')}}]);
