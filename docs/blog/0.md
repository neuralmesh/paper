Recursive AI Improvement Through Open Source Collaboration
Picture an AI that refines its intelligence with every human interaction. This paper discusses the creation of agents that upgrade recursively through continuous conversation and context-based learning. It’s about creating a cycle of endless improvement, all within an openly accessible repository.

It's a non-profit journey where every individual's contribution is acknowledged. The project is not just a paper; it's an open invitation to be part of a landmark in AI research, where the list of co-authors grows with every contribution.

Do you want to influence the future of AI? Engage in this collective project and help us shape intelligent agents that learn from the crowd. It’s a ground-breaking approach that champions open collaboration and shared progress in aligning large language models. Join us, contribute, and advance the frontier of AI together.
