okay so apparently there is no simple way to merge two forks

i think that would actually be a really good way to homogenize and standardize a lot of repos

for instance my use case right now is to use the llmos and merge it with gitea

the goal is to create ultra minimal docker containers which do exactly one job

and with llmos we have one script that will set up the complete environment

and its in a form that is easily predictable

later it will be orchestrated with docker compose and kubernetes

but for now it just needs to let me quickly develop these docker services
