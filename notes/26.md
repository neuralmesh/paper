okay so from what i could gather:

- taskweaver as of now is specialized for data analysis
- opencopilot is more like a widget that you can import into existing apps

what i need is just basic workflow automation for now

the workflows will have calls to an api

this can be done with litellm and ollama

i have understood litellm and ollama enough to get this working

so my plan for right now is

write a sequence of bash scripts manually

1. creating a note (done already)
2. calling an llm api via litellm with the file content

- for now routed to ollama
- which has a custom prompt for converting it into a more information dense version
- i.e. a tweet
- writing that file to the tweets folder

3. stage and commit it to github
