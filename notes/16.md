okay so i guess i really need to produce something that changes the world in the first step

i think the idea with finetuning a llm on my own data should be easy

first idea for alignment:
1. export data from chatgpt
2. extract all my texts from it
3. finetune a foundation model on it
-> maybe need some ways to filter out if there are things i dont want the model to know

second idea for alignment:
1. export data from chatgpt
2. for each conversation:
    1. take all my questions
    2. identify the core questions from the chains of iterative thoughts
    3. identify a single correct answer to the core question
    4. use that as a single training example of how to ask and answer optimal questions
-> problem: how to handle my timetravel technique

third idea for alignment:
the game
-> you own your data and local llms will be finetuned on your local data
