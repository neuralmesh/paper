i have now set up a minimal docker container thing

it is the neuralmesh/llmos aka project losllamaos

i need to find a good way to link information across this network

maybe some form of client side graph query to internal information

this is basically the stem cell from which complexity will be generated

its the root.

i can now clone that one and it will already contain the blog and the scripts and the container and the run script
