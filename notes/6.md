did some research bpkg and first package https://chat.openai.com/share/4e24a9e6-2d13-4893-abee-11b0f68f1df8 

this repo will be at neuralmesh/llmos aka project losllamaos which will be a llm powered operating system

which will be runnable with just one command

you will interact with it with just a browser

users will be able to customize it to exactly what they want

it can be then connected to a bunch of different services via api

like instagram

or whatsapp

or signal

or email

and so on.

okay so for now we for the paper repo

we will actually need to figure out how to handle the blog markdown files

right now they are bothering me beccause they dont allow for smooth fork syncing

what would be the solution?

do we even need commit messages?
just use an autonomous agent that runs the git commit with a llm giving the commit message

we can use load balanecd ollama instances

and then later build the game on that technology
