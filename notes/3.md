use attention masks in the system promt to guide attention of the model.

then also have a gpt convert the ultra speccialized way of thinking that is unique to everyone.

we also need to use open encryption standards because this needs to be secure.

i.e. it should be ultra secure but in the end its just a username and password

so we should make it as easy as possible

at this point i got this bash one liner:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
find "${1:-.}" -name "${2:-*}" ${3} -exec echo Filename: {} \; -exec cat {} \;
```

this script will print out the filename and file content of a directory

this is dangerous if someone runs it and passes it somewhere where you have your passwords logged

that could be an exploit

for now its okay but maybe we ccan rewrite that in rust

is this q*?

i am supervising every step the model makes.

i can finetune a model on this procedure

make it use my behaviour patterns
