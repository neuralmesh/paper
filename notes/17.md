the game is heavily inspired by workadventure and similar style games

we need to make it interesting so that people play it not only as an office simulator

maybe like pokemon or animal crossing

there should be like little side quests so you can also get distracted

is this the metaverse?

but only for you.

perhaps we can turn it into something that is more closely resembling workadventure

but with autonomous agents
