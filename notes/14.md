so i moved to docusaurus

the plan is to put raw notes into the notes directory now

then run a custom script that will take in the new note file

sends it to a custom openai assistant to reformulate it

adds a frontmatter similar to a template

writes the formatted blog post to the blog directory

the date in the frontmatter should be the initial creation date of the file

then in the future we may add a revision history plugin

or perhaps thats already supported
