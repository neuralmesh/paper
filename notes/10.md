the goal is to have a locally hosted version control system

gitea seems like the perfect base for this

and llmos allows us to set it up exactly how we want

the goal is to make it into a node in the graph

for now we will use it to have a persistent index of all the relevant repositories for a project

in my case it will need to list:

- neuralmesh/llmos
- neuralmesh/hub
- neuralmesh/paper

it will also need to be able to instantly mirror pushes to github.com

it must support secure authentication

it must be able to have persistant storage in the case my pc shuts down and it was not yet synced to github

llmos:
(base) mcfrank@goldenticket:~/llmos$ cat Dockerfile
FROM node:alpine
RUN apk add --no-cache git
WORKDIR /app
ENV CONTAINER_PORT=4000
ARG REPO_URL
RUN git clone ${REPO_URL} .
RUN npm install
EXPOSE $CONTAINER_PORT
CMD ["node", "index.js"]

(base) mcfrank@goldenticket:~/llmos$

llmos is basically just an encapsulation layer for any git repository. i have forked it and now we can create a configuration file that contains the OWNER/REPO identifier. the very first though  is to just clone gitea into there and make it run with just one command. this is the current llmos.sh but we need to rename it to install.sh and use a configuration file that defines the envrionment variables. i.e. i want a config.yml in which the git url is specified and this script will use that 

```bash
(base) mcfrank@goldenticket:~/llmos$ cat llmos.sh
#!/bin/bash

if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <git-repo-url>"
    exit 1
fi

REPO_URL=$1

IMAGE_NAME="llmos"
PORT_EXTERN=4000
PORT_INTERN=4000

docker build --build-arg REPO_URL=$REPO_URL -t $IMAGE_NAME .

CONTAINER_USING_PORT=$(docker ps --filter "publish=$PORT_EXTERN" -q)
if [ ! -z "$CONTAINER_USING_PORT" ]; then
    docker stop $CONTAINER_USING_PORT
    docker rm $CONTAINER_USING_PORT
fi

CONTAINER_ID=$(docker run -d -p $PORT_EXTERN:$PORT_INTERN $IMAGE_NAME)

while [ "$(docker inspect --format='{{.State.Running}}' $CONTAINER_ID)" != "true" ]; do
    sleep 1
done

docker exec -it $CONTAINER_ID /bin/sh

```

so i dont know what the easiest way to do that is with minimal effort.

the config should have the image name, port extern, port intern and the repo url

i want a config.yml which will specify the repo url to be cloned, it will also specify the ports and the name and so on. then the llmos.sh will need to be adapted to use this file and pass the repourl as the repo arg to the dockerfile

in the future the config should just use the directory name as the name
