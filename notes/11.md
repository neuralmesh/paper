lets verify step by step

but as a game

the gamification allows people to learn about how ai works

its just text that represents something

you can use time travel techniques

ask a chain of questions that aim to solve just one fundamental taks

identify how the model responds

combine all questions into one prompt

that one will be the representation of the ground truth of the question

when embedded it will precicely reflect the meaning of what youy wanted to ask about

then give that to the model

maybe even reduce the temperature

we can use simulated annealing for setting the temperature

maybe combined with tree of thoughts

and the question compressison

then do the same thing for the solutions

somehow need to automate the identification and compression of the best question embedding

use my chats for that
