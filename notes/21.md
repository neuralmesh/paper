added a script i can add to path

the script just creates a note in the $HOME/paper/notes dir

next step is to use some watching method

then push it to github

then use llms to distribute it in different forms

maybe even multimodal

using [taskweaver](microsoft/taskweaver) now from microsoft

[litellm](BerriAI/litellm) to host ollama as openai compatible api endpoint
