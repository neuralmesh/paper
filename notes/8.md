okay so far the idea is that the llmos.sh will serve as an isolated research env

it takes in a url to a remote git repository

and it should let you directly do all the plain text research you need to do

so the idea now is to also implement a docker container for gitea

we will use ssh or other keys to securely authenticate ourselves

we will use webhooks or something similar for automation

so gitea apparently doesnt support graphql

maybe i should use gitlab

but then again i think it would be helpful to expose a minimal graphql api for gitea?

okay it seems like gitlab is too preconfigured for this

so we should use gitea

we will create a commit object in graphql which will be the interface where we push our commits to

actually this should not be high priority for now. we will just use gitea and the rest api for now
